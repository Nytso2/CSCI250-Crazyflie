# Crazyflie Real-World Green Ball Tracking with ESP32-CAM + OpenCV

[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9ssjhqC-uFs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ssjhqC-uFs)


## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world implementation of green object tracking using a Crazyflie 2.1 drone and an ESP32-CAM module. We capture video using the ESP32-CAM, process it in real-time with OpenCV on a computer, and send flight commands to the drone via the Crazyradio PA USB dongle. This setup mimics vision-based autonomous tracking without heavy onboard computation.

## üß† How It Works

1. **ESP32-CAM** streams live video over Wi-Fi using a lightweight web server (`WebServerCamera.ino`).
2. **Python/OpenCV Script** (`CrazyFlie-Opencv-Following.py`) receives the video stream, identifies the green object (e.g., a ball), and calculates the required motion.
3. **Crazyflie 2.1 Drone** receives movement commands wirelessly via the Crazyradio dongle and follows the object by adjusting yaw, forward motion, and altitude.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `WebServerCamera.ino`: Arduino code for ESP32-CAM to start a video stream on `http://<ip>:81/stream`.
- `CrazyFlie-Opencv-Following.py`: Python script that connects to both the ESP32-CAM stream and the Crazyflie. It performs object detection and sends motion commands based on the target's position and size.
- `CrazyFlieAI.py`: (Optional) Webots simulation script for developing and testing the same tracking logic in a virtual environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### Hardware
- Crazyflie 2.1 drone
- Crazyradio PA (USB)
- ESP32-CAM module
- A Wi-Fi router that both the ESP32 and computer can connect to
- Computer with Python 3 and OpenCV installed

### Software
- Python 3.x
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `cflib` (Bitcraze Python library)

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy cflib
```
To correctly install cflib refer to : https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python

Other dependencies needed:
```bash
time, threading, logging, signal, sys
```
### Setup Guide
- Upload WebServerCamera.ino to your ESP32-CAM using Arduino IDE, and change name & password on credentials, to get your address, use Serial Monitor.
- In CrazyFlie-Opencv-Following.py, set:
```bash
STREAM_URL = "http://<esp32-ip>:81/stream
```
Replace <esp32-ip> with your address provided from your WebServerCamera.ino
- Run your python controller after chaning your URI:
```bash
URI = "radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7"
```
Run :
```bash
python CrazyFlie-Opencv-Following.py
```
### Features:
- Features
- Green object detection via HSV masking and contour detection
- Smooth yaw adjustment and forward motion based on object position and size
- OpenCV live preview of tracking behavior
- Thread-safe video frame capture

## Technical Challenges & Documentation Notes

During real-world testing, we aimed to mount the ESP32-CAM directly on the Crazyflie drone to create a fully autonomous, onboard tracking system. However, this presented several critical challenges:

- **Power Constraints**: The ESP32-CAM requires more power than the Crazyflie can safely provide, especially during flight, which led to instability and power delivery issues. We used a Pololu U1V10F5 to set-up the 3.3v that the crazyflie delivers into stable 5v to provide current to the ESP-32 Camera. This caused a lot of power consumption and the battery died pretty quickly or the crazyflie wouldn't take off because of the weight and the amount of power that was being taken away from the camera, leaving the propellers with low energy.
  
- **Weight Limitations**: Adding the ESP32-CAM, even with a lightweight mount, significantly impacted the drone‚Äôs flight time and maneuverability due to its limited thrust capacity.

- **Connectivity Design**: The solution required both the ESP32 and the computer running OpenCV to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network, which can be limiting in outdoor or mobile scenarios.

As a result, we shifted to an **offboard vision architecture** where:
- The ESP32-CAM acts solely as a wireless camera, streaming video to the host machine.
- The host machine handles all computer vision processing using OpenCV.
- The Crazyflie receives movement commands from the host via the Crazyradio PA dongle.

This hybrid setup preserves flight stability while allowing for real-time vision-based control.
